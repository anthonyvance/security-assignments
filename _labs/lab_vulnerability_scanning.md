The objective of this lab is to create a report of potential vulnerabilities for a virtual machine.
The VM is a Ubuntu-based Linux distribution called MetaSploitable2, which is specifically designed
to teach penetration testing skills such as vulnerability scanning.

During the lab, you may envision yourself as a defender, checking an
organizational assets for vulnerabilities visible from an external perspective
with the ultimate intention of patching them. Alternatively, you may envision
yourself as an attacker, checking a target victim asset for vulnerabilities,
with the ultimate intention of exploiting them. Both defenders and attackers
may perform the same steps of vulnerability scanning.


# Part 0. Ensure that your metasploitable2 instance is up-to-date

The code found at [this url](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/deargle/3b202cca76390051ac9ca02a5e2ac1c4/raw/08586f7b5f879901792b32dab4da66a995485bc9/update-metasploitable-2.sh)
can be run to ensure that your metasploitable2 instance is
up-to-date. For your information, the virtual machines are provisioned using `vagrant`.
**Run the code in a *Kali* terminal.**
Inspect the code at the url before you run it.

    wget -O - https://gist.githubusercontent.com/deargle/3b202cca76390051ac9ca02a5e2ac1c4/raw/08586f7b5f879901792b32dab4da66a995485bc9/update-metasploitable-2.sh | sudo bash

Alternatively, if you are having trouble running `sudo`, then first log in as `root`,
and try running the command again, without `sudo` after the pipe:

    wget -O - https://gist.githubusercontent.com/deargle/3b202cca76390051ac9ca02a5e2ac1c4/raw/08586f7b5f879901792b32dab4da66a995485bc9/update-metasploitable-2.sh | bash

Wait for the command to finish before proceeding.

## Troubleshooting

Metasploitable2 is an ancient operating system. It is prone to crashing and
otherwise behaving unexpectedly suddenly. If Metasploitable stops responding
during the lab, then try force-off'ing it and starting it up again:

# Part 1. Host Discovery and Scanning using NMAP

NMAP is the de facto standard of host discovery and port scanning and has a host of features that make the tool very robust. In this section of the lab, you’ll try a few of NMAP’s features.

<div class='alert alert-info'>Throughout the lab, you should replace <code>&lt;IP.addr.of.metasploitable2&gt;</code> with the actual IPv4 address of Metasploitable.</div>

1.	Open a "Terminal Emulator" window in Kali.
2.  Run all nmap commands as root -- you'll get more information as root for some commands.
    *  "Get root" in your shell (i.e., `sudo -s` or `su root`).
2.	Run `nmap`. Take a quick look at the available options.
3.	Use `nmap` to determine whether the your Metasploitable2 VM is live using a "ping scan":

        nmap -sn <IP.addr.of.metasploitable2>

    The ping scan not only sends an ICMP request, but also an ARP ping, TCP
    pinging, and other techniques to determine if a host is live on the network.

    {% include lab_question.html question="What kind of information is shown when you run this ping scan for Metasploitable2?" %}

    You could also scan a _range_ of IPs using
    [CIDR block notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing#CIDR_notation).
	See the [network map]({{ "/virtual-machines#infosec-net-network-map" | relative_url }}) for the ipv4 block of the infosec-net network.
    This can be fun to do if you also have your vulnerable Windows 7 vm running at the same time, although this is not required.

        nmap -sn <ipv4 CIDR block>

	You can know your network by typing `ifconfig` on either Kali or Metasploitable2, and looking for the `inet` address plus the
  `mask` value on the same line.
	For example, a "mask" of `255.255.255.0` applied to an "inet" address of 192.168.56.17 translates to a network of 192.168.56.0/
  24.
    (Where 24 is the number of bits to mask and it takes 8 bits to make 255, 8x3=24, so that would mask three of the '.' blocks.)


5.	Once you determine that a host is live, you can use NMAP to scan for open ports. Use a TCP scan to determine which ports are open on Metasploitable2:

        nmap -sS <IP.addr.of.metasploitable2>

    This scans approximately 1,800 of the most common TCP ports on the target machine.

    {% include lab_question.html question="Which ports are open on the Metasploitable2 VM?" %}


6.	You can also specify additional ports to scan. Scan the first 10,000 ports of the Metasploitable2 VM:

        nmap -sS -p1-10000 <IP.addr.of.metasploitable2>

    {% include lab_question.html question="Did you find any additional ports?" %}



7.	Nmap can provide additional information about open ports by interrogating the ports it finds using the “sV” flag:

        nmap -sV <IP.addr.of.metasploitable2>

    **Note:** Press the “enter” key to see a status of the NMAP scan.


8.	You can get further information still by using the aggressive flag (“-A”),
    which is a kitchen-sink of sorts.

        nmap -A <IP.addr.of.metasploitable2>

    {% include lab_question.html question="What additional information about the open ports on Metasploitable2 were you able to obtain by using the -sV and -A flags?" %}


9.	A useful feature of nmap is operating system fingerprinting, which it
    accomplishes by profiling how a system responds to its scans.

        nmap -O <IP.addr.of.metasploitable2>

    **Note:** That’s a capital “oh” not a “zero.”

    {% include lab_question.html question="What operating system does nmap report Metasploitable2 to be? " %}


10.	Now scan for web applications on Metasploitable2. Metasploitable2 has many
    intentionally vulnerable web apps.
    A web "application" is a loose
    term for a distinct website, or app, that runs over `http`. Applications may
    run off of different
    base URL paths, all sharing the same port, such as port 80 -- but web
    apps can run off of _any_ port.

        nmap -sV --script=http-enum <IP.addr.of.metasploitable2>

    The scan will list, for a given port, many different `/paths/` that the scan
    found to return HTTP responses. You can browse these ports and paths in Kali's
    web browser. For instance, if a scan of 192.168.56.102 reported that the path `/tikiwiki/`
    was found running on port `4454`, then the app could be investigated by
    entering the following address in a web browser address bar:

      192.168.56.102:4454/tikiwiki/

    (Recall that specifying a `:port` after an address changes the default for
    for a given protocol, and that the default protocol that a web browser tries
    is `http`, which hsa a default port of `80`.)



    <div class='alert alert-info'><strong>Feeling adventurous?</strong> Use a web
    browser to visit the <code>/dvwa</code> path off of Metasploitable2's ip address.
    You'll find an intentionally vulnerable web app. Default username/password is
    on the bottom of the page.</div>

    {% include lab_question.html question="What web applications are available on Metasploitable2?" %}




# Part 2. Nessus


## Start and register the Nessus Scanner

1.  Run the following to install nessus:

        wget -O - https://gist.githubusercontent.com/anthonyvance/f787bfeb56feba8278daa605be464e28/raw/6bdecdb038fab91b0ffcdbe06425b3dd0166cfa5/install-nessus.sh | sudo bash
                
    If you get a sudo-related error, then log in as `root` and run it again, with
    just `| bash` at the end instead of `| sudo bash`.

    <div class='alert alert-info'>
      <p><strong>What did I just run?</strong> The above
    script downloads a code snippet from
    <a class='alert-link' href='https://gist.githubusercontent.com/deargle/d4dc4ea5a877ea13723d8e8ef9c11b08/raw/6ae94d25b0e109ca5aa666c557cacc8ef46e83ba/install-nessus.sh'>here</a>,
    "writes" it to
    std out (that's the <code>-O -</code> bit), and then pipes that code to be
    run by <code>bash</code> as root.</p>

      <p>Any time you see this pattern, take heed -- you are about to run arbitrary
      code on your system. Do you trust it? You should carefully review any script
      you are about to run.
      {% if site.instructorcollab_username == 'deargle' %}
      You <em>did</em> review it before you ran it, right? <i class='far fa-smile-wink'></i>
      {% endif %}</p>
    </div>


1.  Start the nessus daemon

        service nessusd start

    The `d` in `nessusd` stands for 'daemon'.

1.  Open Firefox and browse to `https://kali:8834`. Click 'Advanced' > 'Add Security Exception' > 'Confirm Security Exception' to get past the SSL warning.

1.  Select "Nessus Essentials"

1.  Get a registration activation code by entering an email address.

5.  Choose any `username:password` you prefer for use with nessus. For instance, you could use user `root` password `toor` when prompted by Nessus. Click “reload” if the page fails to load.


## Run a Nessus Scan

1.  Click the "Scans" tab and press the "New Scan" button.

1.  Choose “Basic Network Scan”

1.  In the “Name” field, enter "Metasploitable2" or something more cool-sounding.
    In the “Targets” field, enter the IP address of the MetaSploitable2 VM.

1.	Under the category “Discovery,” change the “Scan Type” to “All ports.”

1.	Under “Assessment”, change the dropdown to "Scan for known web vulnerabilities."

1.	Under “Advanced”, select Scan Type "Custom". Then select “General” on
    the left. Uncheck “Enable safe checks,” and (**Important!**) set "Max number
    of concurrent TCP sessions per host" to 100.

    * Disabling "Safe Checks" tells Nessus that it's okay to run scans that might
      crash the systems being scanned. A user would want to leave safe checks
      enabled if they were scanning a production network!
    * The latter setting about limit number of concurrent TCP sessions prevents
      Nessus from crashing the infosec-net virtual network adapter (see
      [this Nessus forum post for amusing anecdotes about Nessus scans crashing
      corporate firewalls](https://community.tenable.com/s/question/0D5f200004rM1bb/scan-knocking-over-firewalls-policy-tweaks)).

      {% include lab-image.html image='nessus-max-tcp-per-session.png' %}

1.  Click the “Save” button, then click the “Scans” tab at the top of the
    web page. Next, on row of the Metasploitable2 scan you just created,
    click the triangle "play" symbol to launch the scan <i class='fa fa-rocket'></i>.

{% if site.instructorcollab_username == 'deargle' -%}
1.  Virtual-fist-bump your neighbor <i class='fa fa-hand-rock-o'></i> while
    Nessus starts throwing rocks at windows.
{%- endif %}

8.  In the Scans tab you should see the scan job running. This should take about 10 minutes to complete. In the meantime, you can click the job to see the vulnerabilities that Nessus has found so far. Vulnerabilities can be sorted by severity.
